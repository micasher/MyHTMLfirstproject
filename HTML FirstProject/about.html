                <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
                <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations are
                    concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                    (the
                    start of lent in
                    the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting);
                    many
                    days have
                    several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
                    Mardi
                    Gras season. In
                    the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
                    parades
                    and balls (some
                    of them masquerade balls).

                    The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                    parade
                    schedule and route
                    each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                    Knights of Momus and
                    the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                    events
                    (often featuring
                    celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social
                    Aid &
                    Pleasure Club—a
                    predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The
                    most
                    common throws are
                    strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive
                    toys. Major krewes
                    follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                    While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate
                    in the Uptown and
                    Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side
                    of
                    the French
                    Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place
                    downtown in
                    the Faubourg
                    Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
                    concludes with the
                    "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus</p>

                    In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or
                    moved to
                    surrounding
                    communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to
                    the
                    city.
                    Masking,
                    costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order.
                    Guardsmen
                    prevented crimes
                    against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for
                    these
                    reasons, some
                    in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

                    In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations,
                    including
                    Mardi Gras
                    Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
                    sexual
                    orientation,
                    to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city
                    demanded
                    that
                    these
                    krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and
                    the
                    distinctly
                    private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it
                    jurisdiction
                    to
                    demand
                    otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus
                    did
                    parade in
                    the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule
                    in
                    2000.

                    Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                    federal
                    courts later
                    declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
                    association, and an
                    unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court
                    refused to
                    hear
                    the city's appeal from this decision.

                    Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                    dues,
                    and any member
                    can have a place on a parade float.

                <h3>Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</h3>

                <p>nknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades
                    running
                    from
                    January
                    through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of coronavirus disease 2019
                    (COVID-19)
                    in the
                    United States as part of a global epidemic.15 At the time, the disease was actively being dismissed
                    as a
                    major
                    public
                    health threat by President Donald Trump and his administration.16 As such, scrutiny over large
                    public
                    gatherings
                    had
                    yet to emerge, while scrutiny over international travel primarily placed an emphasis on restricting
                    travel
                    from
                    China—the country from which the disease originated.17 15 The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana
                    was
                    reported
                    on
                    March 9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras.18

                    Subsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New Orleans in
                    particular
                    seeing a
                    high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor Susanne Straif-Bourgeoi
                    suggested
                    that
                    the
                    rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras festivities.19 20 Researchers of the University of
                    Louisiana
                    at
                    Lafayette determined that Louisiana had the fastest growth rate of cases (67.8%, overtaking New
                    York's
                    66.1%
                    growth) in
                    the 14 days since its first reported case than any region in the entire world.21 19

                    Mayor LaToya Cantrell stated that she would have cancelled Mardi Gras festivities had she been
                    provided
                    with
                    sufficient
                    warning by the federal government, and criticized the Trump administration for downplaying the
                    threat.15
                    22
                    Amid
                    continued spread of COVID-19 across the country, in early-November 2020 Cantrell stated that
                    celebrations in
                    2021 would
                    have to be "something different", as Mardi Gras could not be canceled outright since it is a
                    religious
                    observance. A
                    sub-committee of the Mardi Gras Advisory Committee focused on COVID-19 proposed that parades still
                    be
                    held
                    but
                    with
                    strict safety protocols and recommendations, including enforcement of social distancing, highly
                    recommending
                    the
                    wearing
                    of face masks by attendees, discouraging "high value" throws in order to discourage crowding, as
                    well as
                    discouraging
                    the consumption of alcohol, and encouraging more media coverage of parades to allow at-home
                    viewing.23
                    As parades and large gatherings were canceled for the 2021 Mardi Gras season in New Orleans, some
                    locals
                    spent
                    extra
                    effort to decorate their homes and front yards for the holiday. Some nicknamed this "Yardi Gras".24
                    On November 17, 2020, Mayor Cantrell's communications director Beau Tidwell announced that the city
                    would
                    prohibit
                    parades during Carnival season in 2021. Tidwell once again stressed that Mardi Gras was not
                    "cancelled",
                    but
                    that it
                    would have to be conducted safely, and that allowing parades was not "responsible" as they can be
                    superspreading
                    events.25 26 This marked the first large-scale cancellation of Mardi Gras parades since the 1979
                    police
                    strike.27 28 Other krewes subsequently announced that they would cancel their in-person balls,
                    including
                    Endymion and
                    Rex (who therefore did not name a King and Queen of Mardi Gras for the first time since World War
                    II).29
                    27
                    28
                    On February 5, 2021, in response to continued concerns surrounding "recent large crowds in the
                    Quarter"
                    and
                    variants of
                    SARS-CoV-2 as Shrove Tuesday neared, Mayor Cantrell ordered all bars in New Orleans (including those
                    with
                    temporary
                    permits to operate as restaurants) to close from February 12 through February 16 (Mardi Gras), and
                    prohibited
                    to-go
                    drink sales by restaurants, and all packaged liquor sales in the French Quarter. To discourage
                    gatherings,
                    pedestrian
                    access to Bourbon Street, Decatur Street, Frenchmen Street between 7:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m., and
                    Claiborne
                    Avenue
                    under
                    the bridge, was restricted by checkpoints to those accessing businesses and homes within the areas.
                    Mayor
                    Cantrell
                    stated that she would "rather be accused of doing too much than doing too little." The move caught
                    some
                    establishments
                    off-guard, as they had been preparing for and anticipating business on Mardi Gras.30 31
                    Parades were allowed to return for 2022.32 In December 2021, the city announced that parades would
                    have
                    modified
                    routes in 2022 due to New Orleans Police Department staffing shortages.33 34 On January 6, 2022,
                    Mayor
                    Cantrell
                    stated during a kickoff event that "without a doubt, we will have Mardi Gras in 2022", citing high
                    COVID-19
                    vaccination
                    rates, and customarily asked residents to "do everything that we know is necessary to keep our
                    people
                    safe."
                    The
                    Krewe
                    de Jeanne D'Arc ceremonially led their parade with a group of marchers in plague doctor outfits and
                    brooms,
                    tasked to
                    "sweep the plague away".
                    The city announced COVID-19 protocols for Mardi Gras 2022 in February 2022, which requires, at a
                    minimum,
                    all
                    participants in a parade (including marchers, performers, and those a riding a float) to present
                    proof
                    of
                    vaccination or
                    a negative COVID-19 test from within the past 72 hours. Some krewes chose to not accept negative
                    tests
                    at
                    all,
                    while
                    some krewes (such as the Krewe of Muses, which also announced plans to have COVID-19 rapid tests as
                    throws)
                    had
                    already announced vaccination requirements for parade participants ahead of the official
                    requirement.
                    Despite
                    the
                    presence of Omicron variant, city health director Jennifer Avegno stated that she was confident
                    Mardi
                    Gras
                    could
                    be
                    conducted in a more normal fashion over 2021

                        <p>Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding
                            solutions to violent crime. Starting
                            with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has
                            focused on her #fairshare
                            initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green
                            spaces. As part of that
                            initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid
                            manufacturers and
                            distributors.

                            During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
